## Who am I 

- 👋 Hi, I’m @john-albright
- 👀 I’m interested in... foreign languages, travel, linguistics, music, vocal arts, programming, and education/teaching.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... various frameworks and libraries for programming (e.g. React, Express, Flask)
- 💻 I can't wait to learn... C++, Scala (for functional programming), Django, more JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Angular and Vue), Spring (Java framework), .NET (C# framework)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... applications that present free educational content (e.g. an automated SRS application, a language learning platform) or any type of full-stack project using a stack like MERN or no stack at all.
- 🚗 I've traveled to 17 countries mainly in Europe and Asia -- my most recent trip was a road trip around Lake Michigan starting in Chicago, driving through Michigan's two peninsulas, and stopping in Milwuakee, Wisconsin!
- I've lived in two countries outside of the US (my home) for extended periods of time: India (1 school year) and Spain (~3 school years).
